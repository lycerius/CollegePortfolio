# Nathan C. Purpura - College Portfolio
  This repo is a collection of projects that I have completed during my time at Wentworth Institute of Technology.
  Some information to keep in mind while browsing my projects:
  <ul>
    <li>Each folder reperesents a different class that I took in college (in no particular order)
    <li>Since learning is an itterative process and these projects were coded at varying times, not all of them reflect my current skill and should be used more as proof that I understand a concept
  </ul>
